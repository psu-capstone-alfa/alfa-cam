team alpha final presentation
=============================

- recap
  - how much is really recap, how much is just context?

  - we are building a program assessment manager
    - help the CEE department ease the pain of ABET accreditation
    - track curriculum changes and implement continuous improvement processes for instructors
  - who we are
    - who are we?
    - just some dudes, right?
  - requirements
    - collect instructor course assessments and share with colleagues
    - map course content to ABET requirements to simplify review process
    - simple and easy to use for non-technical staff

- development plan discussion
  - user stories
    - helpful in determining original project plan
    - identified different use cases
    - didn't always write new functionality in user story format
    - ?
  - iterative development
    - weekly rhythm
    - experienced schedule slippage
    - ?
  - tooling
    - github was awesome
      - initial hump gitting up to speed
      - greatly facilitated distributed development
    - jira/greenhopper
      - too much ceremony for this small of a team/project
      - switched to pivotal tracker (with good success!)
        - allowed a "reboot" and stayed more in touch w/ reality
    - flowdock
      - kept people talking t/o week
      - use gradually increased with time
      - helpful to organize add'l artifacts due to file/link aggregation
  - code acceptance
    - "done criteria"
      - mostly enforced
      - found some automatic tooling support in Cane
    - code review policy
      - always at least 1 other pair of eyes on new code
      - not always 2 as we had hoped
  - points of pain
    - "sunday night/monday morning" merge
    - difficult to achieve/maintain momentum
    - not enough time in the same room?

- risk management
  - no serious risks encountered
    - closest was trickiness in getting CAT deploy
    - is it even worth mentioning?
  - or am i forgetting something?

- results
  - check out this hot hot site baby!
  - maybe a statement from ariel here?

- future work
  - better modeling of course replacement?
  - making things more generic, to be applicable in other depts
  - deeper user testing and UI/UX iteration
    - more online documentation?
  - more/better export options
  - working on the app with the dept during actual ABET process

- deliver/handoff/licensing
  - tarball to CAT
  - documented code + deploy/architecture docs
